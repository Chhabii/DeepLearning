âšªPyTorch Basics #Tensors
ðŸŸ¡Neural networks and Backpropagation, shortly calculates gradients of the loss with respect to the input weights.
ðŸŸ¢Mathematics â€” Jacobians and vectors, Jacobians matrix represents all the possible partial derivatives.
ðŸ”´Dynamic Computational graph : DL frameworks maintain a computational graph that defines the order of computations that are required to be performed

# [Day2](https://github.com/RxnAch/DeepLearning/blob/main/concise_implementation_of_linear_regression.ipynb)

The Topics I learned while coding Implementation of Linear Regression using high-level API of Deep Learning Frameworks.
ðŸŸ¢Typical Procedure for Neural Network which are:
-Define NN that has some parameters.
-Iterate over a dataset inputs and process input through the Network
-Compute loss
-Propagate gradients back into the network's parameters
-Update weights and using them compute for the inputs.
âšªHigh-level APIs are really helpful.

# [Day3](https://github.com/RxnAch/DeepLearning/blob/main/TheImageClassification.ipynb)

ðŸ“·Image Classification:
Image Classification is the process of labeling or characterizing group of pixels or vectors within an image.

ðŸ‘ŸFashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

âœ…Downloaded data and viewed some images.
